Module resolution error: cannot resolve 'path'
/.../test/error-cannot-resolve-node-module/path.js
This looks like base node.js library and unlikely is required in the browser environment.
If you still want to use it, first install the browser implementation with:

		npm install --save path-browserify

And then add this command line option when running fpack:

		--mock path:path-browserify
